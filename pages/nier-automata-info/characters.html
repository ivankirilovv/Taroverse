      <h2>Playable Characters</h2>
      <h3 style="margin-top: 20px">2B (YoRHa No.2 Type B)</h3>
      <img
        src="/images/2b.jpg"
        alt="2B"
        style="height: 275px; width: auto; margin-left: 100px; margin-top: -5px"
      />
      <p style="text-align: left; margin-right: 100px; font-size: x-large">
        2B is one of the main protagonists of NieR: Automata, an android
        designed for combat operations against the machine lifeforms that have
        overrun the Earth. She is stoic, disciplined, and highly skilled in
        battle, often seen adhering strictly to her mission objectives. Despite
        her calm exterior, 2B harbors complex emotions and struggles with the
        existential questions that arise from her experiences on the
        battlefield. Her relationship with her companion, 9S, forms a central
        aspect of the game's narrative, marked by loyalty, tragedy, and
        emotional depth.
      </p>

      <div class="line"></div>

      <h3>9S (YoRHa No.9 Type S)</h3>
      <img
        src="/images/9s.png"
        alt="9S"
        style="height: 250px; width: auto; margin-left: 100px; margin-top: 30px"
      />
      <p
        style="
          text-align: left;
          margin-right: 100px;
          font-size: x-large;
          margin-top: 50px;
        "
      >
        9S is a young male android partnered with 2B in NieR: Automata. Unlike
        2B, he is more emotive, curious, and inquisitive about the world around
        him. 9S possesses advanced hacking abilities, allowing him to access and
        manipulate various systems encountered throughout the game. His
        intelligence and compassion make him a valuable ally to 2B, but also
        lead him to question the morality of their mission and the nature of
        their existence. As the game progresses, 9S undergoes profound character
        development, grappling with themes of identity, loss, and betrayal.

      <h3 style="margin-top: 50px">A2 (YoRHa Type A No.2)</h3>
      <img
        src="/images/a2.webp"
        alt="A2"
        style="height: 250px; width: auto; margin-left: 100px; margin-top: 30px"
      />
      <p
        style="

          margin-right: 100px;
          font-size: x-large;
          margin-top: 50px;
        "
      >
        A2 is a renegade YoRHa android and one of the playable characters in
        NieR: Automata. Unlike the more disciplined and obedient models like 2B
        and 9S, A2 operates independently, driven by her own sense of justice
        and personal vendettas. She is fiercely determined and skilled in
        combat, possessing a strong sense of autonomy and individuality. A2's
        backstory and motivations are gradually revealed throughout the game,
        showcasing her complex relationship with the YoRHa organization and her
        own inner turmoil.

      <h2>Unplayable Characters</h2>

      <h3>Adam and Eve</h3>

          font-size: x-large;
          margin-top: 50px;
        "
      >
        Adam and Eve are twin machine lifeforms created by the Network, the
        collective consciousness of the machines in NieR: Automata. They serve
        as primary antagonists in the game, embodying the machine's quest for
        understanding humanity and their own existence. Adam is characterized by
        his intellectual curiosity and desire to comprehend the nature of life
        and death, while Eve is more emotional and prone to outbursts of rage.
        Their interactions with the protagonists, 2B, 9S, and A2, drive the
        game's narrative forward, leading to a climactic confrontation that
        challenges the boundaries between man and machine.

        androids under her command. She is characterized by her calm and
        authoritative demeanor, serving as a guiding figure for the protagonists
        as they navigate the complexities of their missions. While initially
        distant, the Commander demonstrates a deep concern for the well-being of
        her android soldiers, adding depth to her character as the story
        unfolds.

        of what it means to be human.
