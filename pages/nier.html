        <p>
          "NieR" is set in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by a mysterious
          plague known as the Black Scrawl and besieged by shadowy creatures
          called Shades. The game follows the protagonist, a grizzled
          middle-aged man named Nier, who is on a quest to find a cure for his
          daughter Yonah, afflicted by the Black Scrawl. In the Japanese version
          "NieR Gestalt," Nier is depicted as an older brother searching for a
          cure for his sister, but in the Western release, and universally known
          as "NieR," he is a father.

          Dragon-riding segments allow players to control Mikhail in aerial
          battles, using his powerful breath attacks to defeat enemies and
          support Zero on the ground. The game also incorporates RPG elements,
          such as leveling up, unlocking new abilities, and managing resources
          to upgrade weapons and enhance Zero's combat capabilities.

          perspective, engaging in real-time battles using a variety of weapons
          and magical abilities granted by Grimoire Weiss. The combat system
          emphasizes fluidity and strategy, allowing players to switch between
          weapons and spells seamlessly.

          platforming sections, puzzle-solving, and even text-based adventures,
          creating a rich and varied experience. Players can upgrade their
          weapons, learn new abilities, and interact with NPCs to complete
