        The prince of a kingdom besieged by the Empire. Caim has a grudge
        against dragons in general, as his parents were killed by an Imperial
        black dragon. He is mortally wounded at the beginning of the game, and
        despite his hatred of dragons, he makes a pact with the red dragon
        Angelus to save his life at the cost of losing his voice. Caim's pact
        mark is located on his tongue.

        herself.

        children. Imprisoned by the Empire for her crimes, she forms a pact with
        Undine and Salamander to save her life in exchange for her fertility,

        with Furiae to the Empire.
