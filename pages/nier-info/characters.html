        brother, depending on the version played) determined to save his
        daughter/sister, Yonah, from the grips of a mysterious and incurable
        illness known as the Black Scrawl. His character is defined by his
        unwavering love for his family and his willingness to brave any danger
        to ensure their safety. Despite the hardships he faces in a world
        overrun by monstrous creatures called Shades, NieR remains resolute and

        him on his journey to confront the darkness threatening their world.
