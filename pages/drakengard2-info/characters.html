      />
      <p style="text-align: left; margin-right: 100px; font-size: x-large">
        Nowe is the main protagonist of Drakengard 2. Raised by the ancient
        dragon Legna, he is initially a member of the Knights of the Seal, a
        group dedicated to protecting the world through the use of magical
        Seals. However, as he witnesses the suffering caused by the Seals, he
        begins to question their true purpose and sets out on a journey to
        discover the truth. Nowe is characterized by his strong sense of
        justice, youthful idealism, and inner conflict as he grapples with his
        loyalty to the knights and his growing disillusionment with their
        methods.

      <h3>Manah</h3>

          margin-top: 50px;
        "
      >
        Once a major antagonist in the original Drakengard, Manah is now seeking
        redemption. She played a central role in the destruction and chaos of
        the previous game but has since repented and aims to destroy the Seals
        that she once sought to control. Manah is a powerful sorceress with a
        tragic past marked by manipulation and trauma. Her determination to
        atone for her past actions and her complex relationship with Nowe drive
        much of the game's emotional depth.

        "
      >
        Eris is a skilled and loyal knight of the Knights of the Seal, and a
        childhood friend of Nowe. She is dedicated to her duty and initially
        stands in opposition to Nowe when he turns against the knights. However,
        her unwavering loyalty to Nowe and her own sense of justice eventually
        lead her to join him in his quest. Eris is a strong, dependable fighter
        who struggles with the conflict between her duty and her personal
        beliefs.

        resurrection. Despite his undead state, Urick remains a powerful warrior
        and serves as a mentor and protector to Nowe. His experience and wisdom
        are invaluable to the group, and his tragic backstory adds a layer of

        He is deeply committed to maintaining the power and control of the
        Seals, believing it is the only way to ensure order in the world. Gismor
        views Nowe and his companions as threats to this order and will stop at
        nothing to eliminate them. His authoritarian approach and willingness to
        sacrifice others for his goals make him a formidable antagonist.

        "
      >
        Seere is one of the Seals and a central figure in the game's conflict.
        Despite his young age, he possesses significant magical power and a
        tragic backstory involving the loss of his sister and his role in the
        events of the first Drakengard. Seere's innocence contrasts sharply with
        the heavy burden he carries, and his fate is deeply intertwined with the
        destiny of the world.

        non-playable character whose dark and violent past continues to
        influence the events of the sequel. Silent and driven by a deep-seated
        rage, Caim's actions and decisions have far-reaching consequences that
        affect the lives of many characters in Drakengard 2. His complex history
        with Angelus and his relentless pursuit of his own goals add layers of
        intrigue and tension to the story.
