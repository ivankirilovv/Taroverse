      <h2 style="margin-top: 20px">Ending A: Accord</h2>
      <p style="text-align: center; margin: 10px; font-size: x-large">
        Ending A, also known as the Accord Ending, serves as the true conclusion
        to Drakengard 3, offering players a culmination of the game's complex
        narrative threads and character arcs. As protagonist Zero confronts her
        destiny and the true nature of the Intoners, players are thrust into a
        climactic battle against her sisters and the forces of darkness.
        Depending on the player's actions throughout the game, Ending A offers
        different outcomes, each with its own implications for the fate of the
        world and its inhabitants. The Accord Ending delves deep into the themes
        of sacrifice, redemption, and the cyclical nature of violence,
        challenging players to consider the consequences of their choices and
        the true cost of power.

      <h2>Ending B: Zero</h2>
      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: x-large; margin-top: 50px">
        Ending B, also known as the Zero Ending, delves into the consequences of
        Zero's actions and the toll they have taken on her and her companions.
        As Zero confronts her sisters and the true source of the world's chaos,
        players are presented with a choice that will determine the fate of the
        world and Zero herself. Ending B explores themes of identity, mortality,
        and the pursuit of power, offering a dark and introspective conclusion
        to Zero's journey. Through its haunting imagery and thought-provoking
        narrative, Ending B leaves players with a sense of ambiguity and
        introspection as they contemplate the nature of fate and the choices
        that define us.

      <h2 style="margin-top: 50px">Ending C: One's Prologue</h2>

        Ending C, also known as the One's Prologue Ending, offers players a
        glimpse into the origins of the Intoners and the events leading up to
        the first game in the Drakengard series. Set against the backdrop of a
        world on the brink of destruction, Ending C provides valuable insight
        into the history of the world and the characters introduced in
        Drakengard 3. Through its evocative storytelling and rich lore, Ending C
