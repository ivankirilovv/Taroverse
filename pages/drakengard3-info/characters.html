      <h2>Playable Characters</h2>
      <h3 style="margin-top: 20px">Zero</h3>
      <img
        src="/images/zero.jpg"

      <p style="text-align: left; margin-right: 100px; font-size: x-large">
        Zero is the main protagonist of Drakengard 3, an enigmatic and powerful
        Intoner with a singular mission: to kill her five sisters, the other
        Intoners. Known for her fierce combat skills and ruthless demeanor, Zero
        is driven by a hidden motive that slowly unfolds throughout the story.
        She possesses a mysterious flower growing out of her right eye, which is
        the source of her power. Zero's personality is abrasive, cynical, and
        often violent, but she shows a softer side in her interactions with her
        dragon companion, Mikhail. Her journey is marked by intense battles,
        personal revelations, and the unveiling of deep-seated secrets that
        drive her relentless quest.

          margin-top: 50px;
        "
      >
        Mikhail is Zero's loyal dragon companion, distinct from other dragons in
        the series due to his childlike innocence and naivety. Despite his
        immense power, Mikhail often exhibits a playful and curious demeanor,
        contrasting sharply with Zero's harshness. He is deeply attached to
        Zero, viewing her as a protector and guide. Mikhail's pure-hearted
        nature often brings moments of levity and warmth to the otherwise dark
        and violent narrative. Throughout the game, Mikhail grows both
        physically and emotionally, becoming a crucial ally in Zero's mission.

        One is the eldest of the Intoner sisters and serves as the primary
        antagonist. She is a composed and intelligent leader who believes in her
        divine mission to rule and bring order to the chaotic world. One views
        herself as a benevolent ruler whose authority is necessary for the
        greater good. She perceives Zero's actions as a direct threat to the
        stability and order she strives to maintain. One's motivations are
        complex, blending a genuine desire for peace with a ruthless
        determination to eliminate any opposition, including her own sister.

        "
      >
        Two is one of the Intoner sisters, known for her kind and gentle nature.
        She rules her domain with compassion and is adored by her people.
        However, beneath her sweet and nurturing exterior lies a fragile psyche
        prone to mental instability. Two's susceptibility to emotional
        breakdowns makes her both a sympathetic and tragic figure. Her internal
        struggles and vulnerability add depth to her character, contrasting with
        the power she wields as an Intoner.

        "
      >
        Three is an eccentric and often detached Intoner with a peculiar
        fascination for dolls and grotesque creations. Her whimsical and aloof
        personality hides a darker side, as she takes pleasure in manipulating
        and controlling those around her. Three's creativity is expressed
        through her bizarre and often macabre constructs, reflecting her unique
        view of the world. Despite her seemingly scattered demeanor, she
        possesses a sharp mind and a cruel streak that make her a formidable
        adversary.

        Four is a proud and noble Intoner who embodies purity and righteousness
        in the eyes of her followers. She is deeply committed to her duties and
        strives to maintain a facade of perfection. However, Four is plagued by
        insecurities and jealousy, particularly towards her sisters. These
        hidden feelings of inadequacy and envy drive much of her internal
        conflict, making her character a study in contrasts between her public
        persona and private turmoil.

        Five is the youngest Intoner, characterized by her hedonistic and
        indulgent lifestyle. She revels in pleasure, luxury, and the admiration
        of others, often shirking her responsibilities. Five's carefree and
        sensual demeanor masks a manipulative and cunning mind, capable of using
        her charm to achieve her desires. Her pursuit of self-gratification and
        power highlights her selfishness and moral ambiguity, making her a
        complex and intriguing character.

        Cent is one of Zero's disciples, known for his verbosity and tendency to
        exaggerate his achievements. Despite his habit of bragging and
        embellishing his stories, Cent is deeply loyal to Zero and dedicated to
        her cause. His combat skills and unwavering commitment make him a
        valuable ally. Cent's personality provides both comic relief and moments

        behavior and obsession with women. Despite his often inappropriate and
        distracting antics, Octa is a skilled fighter with a deep sense of
        loyalty to Zero. His combat prowess and unwavering dedication balance
        his more frivolous tendencies, making him a multifaceted character.

        intriguing, adding tension and unpredictability to the group dynamics.
